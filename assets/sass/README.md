# Sass Structure

This project uses the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) writing conventions.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information.

---

# Manifest file (renamed from main to be more semantic)

The manifest file (usually labelled `manifest.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

Reference: [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/) > [Architecture](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) > [Main file](http://sass-guidelin.es/#main-file)
